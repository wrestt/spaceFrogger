# Space Frogger

is a browser based game inspired by traditional frogger. This game is built in a single HTML file and uses React to create the game interface. 

The keyboard arrow keys :arrow_left: :arrow_up: :arrow_down: :arrow_right: are used to control the spaceship in the game. Dodge meteorites as you travel to the safety of a landing pad at the top of the screen. Successfully reaching a landing pad advances you to the next level.

The game can be run by cloning this repo and running a Python SimpleHTTPServer in the cloned directory. All you need is Python installed on your system. 

Run the following command in the cloned directory to start the server:

```$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer```

#### enjoy!!!
